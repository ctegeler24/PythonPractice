# PythonPractice
As I am new to programming, I am starting this to upload my practice projects.

I have been working through the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart and have recently starting using his GitHub page PythonStdioGames to better understand how to apply the python syntax.

With this PythonPractice folder, I am working through the games and animations that he has uploaded and remaking them with my own code for practice purposes. I also hope to add my own projects soon once I have a better understanding.

I am open to any comments on how I could have written my code differently or more efficient ways to write.

Thank you!
